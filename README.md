# bike_sharing_modelling
This project aims to use various machine learning models to predict demand for rental bikes. On the other hand, an hourly-based prediction of bike usage can be used for adjusting rental price accordingly with the demands, time, and data events.
The model used shows as follows.
- Linear Model
- Generalised Additive Model
- GLM with Poisson
- GLM with Binomial
- Support Vector Machine
- Neural Network
